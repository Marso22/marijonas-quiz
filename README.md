# Hack-a-Game
Our first hack-a-thon for the Code Institute

## Collaborators

Working together on this project was a highly rewarding experience for all of us. We enjoyed collaborating, sharing ideas, and learning from each other. One of the biggest lessons we learned was the challenge of coordinating Git across a team. Ensuring that everyone was on the same page and managing merge conflicts required effective communication and organization. This experience has significantly improved our teamwork and version control skills.
